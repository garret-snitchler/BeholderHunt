# Job System?
1. No job changing system. Characters start as the classes you pick for them. This is the least interesting and the most restrcitve, but in a short game it's not necessarily inappropriate.
	You would likely also just pick the player's party for them at this point, like a more traditional RPG, though you could take an Etrian approach and let them choose their party
	What I'd really be taking inspiration from with this is Cthulhu Saves Christmas, as I think it does an excellent job of both establishing roles for party members while still
		giving you a fair amount of flexibility when it comes to figuring out what you want the character to be specializing in combat. No need for full subclasses, just give
		a limited number of skill slots or specific choices of equipment that benefit one playstyle more than the other and you should be good enough to allow for strategizing.
2. Standard Job System - You have a pool of jobs that party members can change between. Certain thinsg are carried over from one job to another, such as spells, abilities, stat gains
	This is a system that would encourage depth and careful design
	Let's think about versions we've experienced:
		DQ3's resetting you to level 1 but giving you a significant amount of stats carried over, as well as spells and abilities.
			You can only change jobs after achieving level 20, which is hard to reach in the early game and fairly easy to reach in the late game.
			There is a single "hidden job" called Sage, though the game itself does a poor job of both communicating that Gadabout transforms into this or that
				its ability to transform into Sage is notable if it's your first time looking at the job change screen
		DQ9 in comparison doesn't reset you at all and is overall lenient when it comes to job switching. It makes use of a visualization to make clear what equipment is only
		usable by certain classes, and this is good as it also lets you know what classes will work even if none of that class is represented in your party. I think this is more
		player friendly than DQ3's version. 
			Similar to XC3, half of this game's jobs are unlocked by doing specific quests. These quests are marked the same way as any other quest is, making them somewhat easily missed.
				I don't think it's a problem if optional jobs are easily missed by blind players, but I don't think they should be permanently missable. 
				It's notable that in DQ9, the job unlock quests also serve as indirect prereq requirements, as they all require you to use skills learned from a base job first. This
				means that for example, if you've gone through the game with no thieves, you won't be able to get the Ranger job unless you take the time to raise a thief. However, this
				isn't much of a hurdle if someone is willing to put a small amount of time down to raising a thief, and then afterwards you could pivot to Ranger with no problems.
		XC3's system of starting with 6 jobs (or one per party member) across 3 different roles and then slowly rolling out more over the course of the game when you do specifc quests
			I think this system had a lot of potential but it had the biggest problem in job systems for me which is that it just homogenized everybody by the mid-game
			I would also say that some jobs struggle to differentiate themselves from others, both in terms of flavor and in gameplay. 
		Stranger of Paradise - Each job has a skill tree and an amount of weapons it can use. Every skill tree gives you unique moves and also ends with unlocking one or more
			other jobs, which was great for doing a prestige-like system. But it must be remembered that this skill tree approach was for when you only had one party member - it
			could easily fall prey to the homogenization issue discussed earlier, and it might also be too much micromanagement to do across multiple party members. If there's
			anything we could take from it it's that giving each job a nonlinear growth track controlled by the player might be fun, as well as the idea that certain jobs could
			serve as prerequisites for other jobs. Also, that while moves carry over across jobs, the idea that every job has a unique ability (of varying complexity) is good for
			making them all feel different
		Metaphor - I haven't finished 'researching' this game's systems yet but I like what it's doing. Jobs fill different roles, there's a limited ability to use one job's skills
			from another job, the game gives you suggestions on which jobs to bring into a given boss fight, job unlocking is through money but otherwise you can change them instantly,
			there are combo skills between jobs, really good stuff across the board here. It also has prestige jobs unlocked by maxing out other jobs, though this is where my research
			lacks because I haven't actually unlocked any of these yet myself. The only issue is that I do think there are some cases where it's hard to really note what makes a given
			class special. Like, seeker VS warrior VS brawler, they do different things but flavor wise it's not super easy to tell compared to the obvious distinctions in something like DQ.
The conflict here is largely between what I think is interesting and what I think is reasonable to do within the scope of this game. I'm more excited about a job system but I'm
still uncertain about the actual length of this game. If this ends up being large I'd spring for a job system, but if we're going for something compact I'd probably say to not.
With that in mind I'm unfortunately going to table the discussion of the specific job changing mechanics until the vision is more clear.

# Jobs
Warrior - Or something along those lines, the intention with this class is to make a simple attack bot. Warriors are notable not for their abilities but for two traits:
	1. Warriors are the class that can wield the most equipment. All the heaviest weapons and armor that most classes couldn't use are a wonderful find for any warriors in your party
	2. Durability. While other classes are reliant upon an MP stat, the warriors will perform as well in the first combat of the adventure as they will in the thirtieth. 

Weirdly I'm not super feeling the classic mage/cleric right now. If I did do a priest I'd distinctly go for a cleric though I like that more than "wizard but in white clothes". 
We'd for sure enforce the blunt weapons only policy. It's also important to me that this is not a required character to have in the party - I'd want there to be other options
in the form of Staffs of Multiheal, consumables that heal multiple people at once, 

Merchant - This is an attempt at having a class that's not really focused on combat at all but is instead there to make things easier outside of combat.
Obvious bonuses are increased gold after battle, better prices when buying and selling. The tricky thing with a merchant is that the value of a merchant in an RPG is directly
correlated with how tight the game's economy is and how valuable money is. If we're not confident that we'll have enough uses for money, then the merchant may not be worth including.

Do we want joke characters? I feel like if you want a joke character they have to just be all Luck or some other super situational stat

NO beastmasters I don't really like those. HOWEVER, I think maybe a class that's part-beast would be cool. I think a dragon-person is my favorite so far?
This is pretty clearly Souls inspired by no shutting ideas down this early!

# Differentiation from a dungeon crawler
The main thing that sets a dungeon crawler apart from a more typical classic RPG, at least in my eyes, is a combination of three things:
	1. How much focus is on resource management
	2. How long are the dungeons
	3. How confusing are the dungeon layouts (teleporter mazes, regular mazes, etc.)
The reason we do this is because, while I like dungeon crawlers, I don't think the intent with Beholder Hunt is to make a dungeon crawler. So maybe avoid doing these things too much 
unless we decide we want to make a dungeon crawler
